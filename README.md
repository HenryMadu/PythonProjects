# My Python Projects

These are beginner Python projects that I am working on to learn and practice Python programming.

## Introduction

This project includes simple Python scripts that perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Through these projects, I am learning more about what Python is and what it can be used for.

I explore how Python works with numbers and how to interact with simple programs, such as a number-guessing game. 
Additionally, I learn how to work with text in Python by building a reusable function to count the words in a block of text. 
Along the way, I tackle quick challenges and other games that allow me to put my new skills to the test.
